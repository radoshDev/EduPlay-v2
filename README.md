# EduPlay - An Educational Application for Kids

Welcome to EduPlay, an innovative application designed to help children enhance their reading and math skills. Below, you'll find information about the technologies I used, how the application works, and what you can expect from it.

## **Used Technologies**

I leveraged a stack of cutting-edge technologies to provide an enriching learning experience:

1. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): My core framework for building the application.
2. [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/): Ensures seamless page routing.
3. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/): Crafting appealing and responsive designs.
4. [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/): Empowering my state management.
5. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): For rigorous testing.
6. Configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for added convenience.

## **How It Works**

EduPlay is a versatile learning tool with the following key features:

### **Creating an Account**

- You have the option to create an account using your email and password or your GitHub credentials.

### **Adding Students**

- After logging in, you can create student profiles by clicking the "+" button.
- Fill in the necessary details, including their name, select an avatar, choose the difficulty level, and set the task round length.

### **Choosing Task Types**

- EduPlay offers four distinct task categories:
  - "Бібліотека": Explore subcategories and more.
  - "Математика": Dive into math tasks.
  - "Читання": Focus on reading tasks.
  - "На монети": Engage in a mix of tasks.

### **Learning Process**

- Once you've selected a task type, a task will be presented for educational purposes.
- Upon completing each round, the student earns a coin.
- The round length is customizable based on the student's preferences.
- After each round, a random creature image is displayed.

### **Additional Functionality in Task Section**

- In the top-right corner, click on the three dots for options like changing students and restarting learning.
- The "W" icon allows you to explore word explanations on Wikipedia.
- Click on the image icon to view images related to the word via Google Images.

  - Logout button
  - Account name and role
  - Theme switcher (dark/light)
  - Navigation buttons to the creature and task lists
  - Student progress tracking with the ability to select periods (weekly, monthly, and yearly).
